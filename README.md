A clean, responsive, single-page webapp template for developers. View demo at [johoop.vercel.app](https://johoop.vercel.app)

-   built using [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
-   styled with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
-   deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and hosted at [johoop.vercel.app](https://johoop.vercel.app)

Kudos to [José Coelho](https://github.com/jcoelho93/personal-website) and [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/bchiang7.github.io) for the inspiration.

## Features

-   All of the personal information is populated from the resume.json file following the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, a community driven open source initiative to create a JSON based standard for resumes. Discover the official schema [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).
-   The toggle/switch for the dark mode syncs its state to the local storage.

#### Coming soon

-   Two beautiful resume page templates generated based on the data in the resume.json file -- a modern approach of the traditional printed CV.
