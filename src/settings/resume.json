        "summary": "I built this portfolio website you are currently viewing with **React**. This website was originally a fork of [**Jolien Hoop**](https://jolienhoop.com)'s website but has been vastly improved and changed to reflect my personal needs in a personal website. Most overall styling was preserved from the fork, however there is plenty of tweaks I made for component positions or otherwise. In a similar vein, all styling for the translucent cards with content originates from my good friend [**Eric Knocklein**](https://ericknock.netlify.app)'s website and of course with some tweaks of my own. Page styling in general is all custom built with these reusable components and with my needs in mind. Most of my practical work experience has been in front-end **JavaScript** development, so this website is a continuation and representation of my current skills and abilities as a software engineer both in design and in content. This website, like Eric's, is also built to be modular such that anyone can adapt the source code for this website to their own tailored needs (given they appreciate the same type of styling and JSON data imports for only front-end information).\n\nAll the data that builds the website is stored in one **JSON** file, called `resume.json` that are interpreted and displayed as you see them now. Even this page of text is stored within a JSON object's property/field. This type of data manipulation allows this website to be almost completely modular. The process of creating this website has been a continuing learning experience with React. Having prior experience developing within a React framework, developing this website gave me a broader understanding of a React web app's structure and code flow.\n\nSimilar to Eric's descrption of his website, I can confidently say this website utilizes a sort of Model View Controller (MVC) architecture/pattern, where the index page handles all routing/requests as the controller, each page is a template for data (so it classifies as a view), and the data rendered from the JSON file is the model being rendered.\n\nThis project isn't the my first rodeo with web development styling; refer to my [**volleyball website**](/portfolio/projects/volleyball_website) I developed for my Applications of Databases class at UMW that was coded in PHP and uses a MySQL (MariaDB) back-end.\n\nI hope to keep this site up to date and add more flare to it as my career and life continues. I have many ideas for continuations to this site, such as a blog or making this much more mobile screen accessible. For the time being though, I am extremely excited with how much I was able to accomplish with this website in its current state and will proudly advertise it as an extension of myself.",
